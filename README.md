## W6 Milestone - ODUS

This week, team ODUS focused on onboarding all collaborators into Github and establishing the skeleton and environment.

We created 6 user stories found in the project board to guide our inital development. 

In addition, we also developed an inital working CI.

As of now, since we focused on requirement analysis and project planning this week, there are no instructions for how to initialize our web application just yet.
