## W6 Milestone - ODUS

This week, team ODUS focused on onboarding all collaborators into Github and establishing the skeleton and environment.

We created 6 user stories found in the project board to guide our inital development. 
Here is our link to our project board:

In addition, we also developed an inital working CI.

As of now, since we focused on requirement analysis and project planning this week, therefore are no instructions for how to initialize our web application as we do not have a prototype just yet.
