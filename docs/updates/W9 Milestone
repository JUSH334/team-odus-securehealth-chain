### Evidence of Authorization Enforcement

#### Successful Protection Against Unauthorized Access
```
Test 2: Non-admin CANNOT grant roles
├─ Attacker: 0x90F7...b906
├─ Attempted Action: grantRole(PROVIDER_ROLE, victim)
├─ Result: ❌ REVERTED
├─ Error: "UNAUTHORIZED: Admin role required"
└─ Gas Consumed: 23,847 (reverted, no state change)

Test 4: Non-provider CANNOT create records
├─ Attacker: 0x90F7...b906
├─ Attempted Action: createMedicalRecord(fake_record)

├─ Error: "UNAUTHORIZED: Provider role required"
└─ Impact: Medical data remains secure ✅

Test 6: Unauthorized user CANNOT access records
├─ Attacker: 0x90F7...b906

##  Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **On-Chain Authorization is Essential**: UI-only checks are insufficient for healthcare data
2. **Gas Optimization Matters**: Initial record creation cost was 340K gas, optimized to 187K
3. **Testing Saves Time**: Comprehensive tests caught 8 critical bugs pre-deployment
4. **DIDLab Network Characteristics**: Slower than Ethereum mainnet but significantly cheaper

### Process Improvements
1. **Test-First Development**: Writing tests before implementation improved code quality
2. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploying to testnet early revealed network-specific issues
3. **Documentation Importance**: SECURITY_NOTES.md clarified design decisions for team
4. **User Feedback**: Early prototype testing identified MetaMask UX issues

### What Went Well 
- Clean separation of concerns (contract/backend/frontend)
- Robust authorization model preventing unauthorized access
- Comprehensive test coverage exceeding requirements
- Clear documentation enabling future contributors

### What Could Improve 
- Earlier security audit engagement (should start in M1)
- Automated CI/CD pipeline (manual testing was time-consuming)
- More comprehensive frontend testing (currently untested)
- Performance monitoring from day 1 (added in M2)
