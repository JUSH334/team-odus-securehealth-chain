W7 Milestones - Vertical Slice

### Progress
This week, we successfully completed the implementation of "One end-to-end path: client → contract/chaincode → state change/event." demonstrating a verifiable on-chain effect:
- Client Integration: Built a minimal CLI client capable of invoking a smart contract action with a single command
- Smart Contract Logic: Implemented a contract function that updates on-chain state and emits a corresponding event
- Read-Back Proof: Developed a verification script that queries the blockchain to confirm the new state or event emission
- Architecture Documentation: Created a visual architecture diagram highlighting the full request-to-ledger path
- Automated Testing: Added a test suite covering both the happy path and one edge case, ensuring reliable functionality

### Evidence
Deliverables completed:
- Functional end-to-end path: client → contract → on-chain state/event → read-back
- CLI or web-based trigger that performs a verifiable state change
- Architecture diagram (docs/diagrams/architecture)
- Proof GIF (docs/proof.gif) showing the action → confirmation flow
- CI pipeline running successfully with test coverage

Artifacts:
- Source code for client, contract, and verification scripts
- Test logs confirming successful execution
- CI output showing passing tests

### Technical Depth
Implementation Details:
- Contract designed to handle a single state variable update with an emitted event on change
- Verification script reads updated contract state or event log to confirm results
- Diagram and documentation outline the entire data path for transparency

Challenges Addressed:
- Ensured end-to-end consistency between contract and client
- Established deterministic state verification for testing
- Integrated CI pipeline for automated validation

Next Week's Plan
- Extend the contract with additional state transitions and events
- Expand test coverage to include failure conditions and event assertions
- Add web client option for browser-based interaction
- Update documentation with deployment instructions

Collaboration
- Communication and workflow practices established:
- GitHub repository with defined branching and PR review process
- Shared documentation in docs/ for architecture and testing details
- Regular syncs for progress updates and issue tracking
